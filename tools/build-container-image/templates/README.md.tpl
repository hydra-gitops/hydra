### Download CLI archives

Release assets are published on each signed version tag:

- https://github.com/{{REPO}}/releases/latest

Verify downloaded archives with the published checksum file:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/{{REPO}}/releases/latest/download/checksums.txt
shasum -a 256 --check checksums.txt
```

## Verify releases

Public keys are published in [.github/secrets/public-keys.yaml](.github/secrets/public-keys.yaml).

- Release tag signatures are verified before release jobs start.
- Downloaded CLI archives can be checked against `checksums.txt`.
- CLI archives are signed during the release workflow.
- Published container images are signed by digest.
