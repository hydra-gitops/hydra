# hydra local source

Print unrendered Helm chart template files from disk for one or more apps. This command does **not** run the Hydra render pipeline and does **not** output Kubernetes manifests.

## Synopsis

```text
hydra local source <appId> [appId...] [flags]
```

## Description

For each selected app, Hydra loads the chart with the same Helm loader as rendering (including **packaged** dependencies under `charts/*.tgz`). Template bodies and `# Source:` paths come from that loaded chart, not only from loose files on disk — so umbrella charts without a top-level `templates/` directory still show their dependency templates.

`# Source:` paths are Helm’s internal template file names (usually forward slashes), which may differ from a raw repository directory layout.

Bodies may contain Helm directives (`{{ … }}`); the stream is **not** valid Kubernetes YAML.

When `--color` / `--color-mode` request colored terminal output, Hydra highlights the template body with [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma): delegating lexer **YAML + go-text-template** (YAML in the gaps between `{{ … }}`, template actions highlighted as Go templates).

Use `--exclude-app` to remove specific apps from the selection (same glob patterns as other multi-app local commands).

Use `--include-path` (repeatable) to print only files whose **Helm template path** (as in `# Source:`) matches in either of these ways:

1. **Prefix from the chart root** (path boundary after the prefix): the path equals the prefix, or the next character is `/`.
2. **Segment path inside the full Helm name** (only when the flag value contains at least one `/`): the path contains `/<your-prefix>/` or ends with `/<your-prefix>`. This covers umbrella charts where Helm prefixes template names (for example `# Source: kube-prometheus-stack/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/templates/prometheus/...`): you can still pass `charts/kube-prometheus-stack/templates/prometheus` or the full path from the error message.

So `templates/foo` matches `templates/foo/bar.yaml` but does **not** match `templates/foobar.yaml`. To match a single file, pass the full chart-relative path including the file name (for example `templates/kafkauser-a.yaml`), or a multi-segment suffix such as `templates/prometheus/clusterrole.yaml` when that sequence appears in the Helm path.

Multiple `--include-path` values are combined with **OR** semantics.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appId`  | One or more [App IDs](../README.md#app-ids) (supports [wildcards](../README.md#wildcards)) |

## Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--hydra-context` | | Path to the [Hydra context directory](../README.md#hydra-context) (or set `HYDRA_CONTEXT` env var) |
| `--color` | `-c` | Force colored output |
| `--no-color` | | Disable colored output |
| `--color-mode` | | Color mode: `auto`, `always`, or `never` |
| `--helm-network-mode` | | [Helm network mode](../README.md#helm-network-mode): `online`, `local`, `offline`, or `error` |
| `--no-cache` | | Disable persistent Helm template cache and in-process Helm-related caches for this run |
| `--exclude-app` | | Glob pattern to exclude applications (repeatable) |
| `--include-path` | | Helm template path filter (repeatable, OR): prefix from chart root or contained multi-segment path; see [Description](#description) |

## Examples

```bash
# All template files for one app
hydra local source prod.infra.monitoring --hydra-context /path/to/context

# Only files under a dependency’s prometheus templates directory
hydra local source prod.infra.prom --include-path charts/kube-prometheus-stack/templates/prometheus

# Multiple prefixes
hydra local source prod.infra.prom \
  --include-path charts/kube-prometheus-stack/templates/prometheus \
  --include-path charts/kube-prometheus-stack/templates/alertmanager
```
