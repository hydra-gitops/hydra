# CI Pipeline Tests

## Overview

This document describes the test cases for all CI pipelines (`hydra ci run <pipeline>`).
Each section defines the tests that are implemented or planned for a specific
pipeline or cross-cutting concern.

**See also:** [pipeline.md](pipeline.md) for pipeline architecture and behavior,
[cli.md](cli.md) for the Cobra command structure,
[overview.md](overview.md) for the module hierarchy.

## 1. Change Detection Tests

Test cases for the build-tag based change detection algorithm
(see [pipeline.md — Change Detection](pipeline.md#change-detection)).

| New dev directory created            | New app with `dev/` added, no prior tag                | Detected as changed    |

## 2. Version Calculation Tests

Test cases for computing the correct Helm chart version from `Chart.yaml`
(see [pipeline.md — Versioning Scheme](pipeline.md#versioning-scheme)).

| Extra version (second) | `1.200.9-1-dev` already exists in registry | `1.200.9-2-dev` |
| Extra version prod     | `1.200.9` already exists in registry       | `1.200.9-1`     |

## 3. Configuration Tests

Test cases for parsing and validating `.hydra-ci.yaml`
(see [pipeline.md — Configuration](pipeline.md#configuration-hydra-ciyaml)).

| Test Case                     | Given                        | Expected                         |

## 4. Test Pipeline Tests

Test cases for `hydra ci run test`
(see [pipeline.md — Pipeline: test](pipeline.md#pipeline-test)).

(see [pipeline.md — Pipeline: release](pipeline.md#pipeline-release)).
Core logic and `--local` / `--dry-run` behavior are covered in
`hydra-go/core/ci/release_test.go`; full CI (remote) mode is still a stub.

| Test data changed    | Rendered manifests differ from stored data     | Auto-commit with refreshed test data    |
| No changes           | Rendered manifests match stored data           | Pipeline passes, no commit              |
| Second diff detected | Auto-commit already made, new diff on next run | Pipeline fails, manual review required  |
| Governance limit     | More than one auto-commit per MR attempted     | Pipeline fails                          |
| Commit message       | Auto-commit created                            | `update: refresh unit test data [auto]` |
| MR status            | Test data up to date                           | MR passes `update` check                |

## Test Data

Tests follow the **golden file pattern** used throughout the project
(see [overview.md](overview.md#testing-strategy)).

### File Conventions

| Pattern           | Purpose                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.given.yaml`    | Input fixture — describes the test scenario                                                                 |
| `*.expected.yaml` | Expected output — **auto-generated**, do NOT edit manually                                                  |
| `.hydra-ci.yaml`  | Pipeline configuration fixture per test case (in production there is only one global file in the repo root) |
| `Chart.yaml`      | Helm chart metadata fixture                                                                                 |

### Rules

- `.expected.yaml` files are **auto-generated** — do NOT add comments
- Add comments explaining test scenarios to `.given.yaml` files
- Use `-update` flag to regenerate golden files: `go test ./... -update`
- Test data is embedded via `//go:embed` directives

---

## Running Tests

### All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests across all modules (build, lint, vet, test)
./test.sh
```

The test script runs for each module (`base`, `core`, `cli`):

1. `go mod tidy`
2. `gofmt -w .`
3. `go vet ./...`
4. `staticcheck ./...`
5. `gopls check`
6. `go build ./...`
7. `gotest -v ./...`

### Pipeline Tests Only

```bash
go test ./... -v -run TestPipeline
```text

### Update Golden Files

```bash
# Regenerate all expected files
./update_testdata.sh

# Or with the -update flag
go test ./... -update
```

### Dry-Run Verification

For promote and upgrade tests that interact with Git or GitLab, use the
`--dry-run` flag in integration tests to validate logic without side effects.

## Package `git`

The `git` package provides the shared Git abstraction used by both
pipelines and tests. See [git.md](git.md) for the full API reference.
